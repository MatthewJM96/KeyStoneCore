#   NOTES   #
#-----------#

# MAJOR NOTES:
# DO NOT EDIT THE LAYOUT OF THIS DOCUMENT... EVER!!!
# DO NOT EDIT THE VALUES 'idcount' and 'id' - THIS IS ESSENTIAL!
# DO NOT CHANGE THE FORMAT OF THE VALUE 'latestRemovalCount'

# When configuring this file:
#
# Do NOT use tab, use standard spaces (2 spaces are roughly equal to a tab)
# To avoid this, I recommend using Notepad++ over the standard Notepad (Google it if you don't already have it)
# When using Notepad++ you can change tabs to be replaced by a configurable number of spaces by going to the
# Settings tool bar option, then to Preferences and finally to Language Menu/Tab Settings.
#
# Do NOT change the format of the files; i.e. if an option is indented, don't remove the indentation.
#
# If you want to add extra information for extra ease of use; all comment lines should start with a hashtag.
    # Hopefully adding extra comments should be unneseccary as I
    # Aim to keep this config file as well explained as I can.
#
# For any number values never include decimals if they are not initially provided (i.e. 20 should not
# be changed to 20.1 or 20.1234)
